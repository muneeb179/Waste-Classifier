# ♻️ Waste Classification Expert System

A simple Python-based expert system that helps classify everyday waste items into categories like **Organic**, **Plastic**, **Hazardous**, etc., and suggests appropriate disposal actions such as **Recycle**, **Compost**, or **Take to collection point**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Classifies household waste based on a predefined rule set
* ➕ Allows users to **add new waste items** and update the classification system dynamically
* 📋 Displays all current rules in a neat tabular format
* 📊 Provides a **category-wise summary** using NumPy analytics
* 🖥️ Interactive **command-line menu** for easy user interaction
* 🧠 Code divided between two team members for collaboration and modularity

---

## 📁 Project Structure

* `rules`: Stored in a pandas `DataFrame` for easy management
* `classify()`: Determines category and disposal action
* `add_rule()`: Adds a new classification rule
* `show_rules()`: Prints all rules
* `show_summary()`: Shows summary counts of each category using NumPy
* `show_menu()`: Runs the text-based interactive system

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **pandas** – for structured rule management
* **NumPy** – for category analysis and summary statistics

---

## 📦 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python waste_classifier.py
   ```

---

## 👨‍💻 Team Division

* **Member 1**: Implemented rule base, classification logic, rule addition, and display
* **Member 2**: Implemented category summary analytics and user interaction menu system

---

## 📌 Example Use Case

```bash
--- Waste Classifier Menu ---
1. Classify a waste item
2. Add a new rule
3. Show all rules
4. Show category summary
5. Exit
```

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add a GUI or web interface
* Save and load rules from CSV or database
* Suggest alternatives for hazardous items
* Include language localization support
